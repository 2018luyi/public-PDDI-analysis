Do not co-administer aliskiren with MICARDIS HCT in patients with diabetes (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ).; In a large-scale, long-term clinical efficacy study, the combination of telmisartan and ramipril resulted in an increased incidence of clinically important renal dysfunction (death, doubling of serum creatinine, dialysis) compared with groups receiving either drug alone. ; Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium, therefore, frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. ; Limited experience in controlled and uncontrolled trials combining ALTACE with a calcium channel blocker, a loop diuretic, or triple therapy (beta-blocker, vasodilator, and a diuretic) indicate no unusual drug-drug interactions. ;

Warfarin : Telmisartan administered for 10 days slightly decreased the mean warfarin trough plasma concentration, this decrease did not result in a change in International Normalized Ratio (INR).; When co-administering telmisartan and ramipril, the response may be greater because of the possibly additive pharmacodynamic effects of the combined drugs, and also because of the increased exposure to ramipril and ramiprilat in the presence of telmisartan.;
