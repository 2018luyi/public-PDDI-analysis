Adefovir	Aciclovir	Coadministration has not been studied. Aciclovir is eliminated primarily unchanged in the urine via active renal tubular secretion. Adefovir is excreted renally, by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. Coadministration of adefovir with other medicinal products that are eliminated by tubular secretion or alter tubular function may increase serum concentrations of either adefovir or the co-administered medicinal product.

Adefovir	Alendronic acid	Co-administration has not been studied. There is no evidence in humans or animals that alendronic acid undergoes metabolism, therefore, a pharmacokinetic interaction appears unlikely. However, if taken at the same time, it is likely that food and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicinal products will interfere with absorption of alendronate. Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medicinal product. 	(See Summary)

Adefovir	Alverine citrate	Coadministration has not been studied but based on limited understanding of metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. However as alverine citrate affects gastric motility, an effect on the absorption of adefovir cannot be ruled out. Doses of adefovir and alverine should be separated by 4 hours if possible.

Adefovir	Amphotericin B	Caution is advised as co-administration of adefovir may increase serum concentrations of either drug via competition for renal excretion pathways or affecting renal function. Close monitoring of renal function is required. 	Caution is advised in patients receiving other medicinal products that may affect renal function or are excreted renally (e.g. cyclosporin and tacrolimus, intravenous aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, pentamidine, vancomycin, or medicinal products which are secreted by the same renal transporter, human Organic Anion Transporter 1 (hOAT1), such as cidofovir). Co-administration of 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil with medicinal products in these patients may lead to an increase in serum concentrations of either adefovir or a co-administered medicinal product. The renal function of these patients should be closely monitored with a frequency tailored to the individual patient's medical condition.Hepsera Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, August 2009.

Adefovir	Ciclosporin	A pharmacokinetic interaction between adefovir and ciclosporin is considered unlikely. As ciclosporin can affect renal function, close monitoring is recommended.	A clinical study in liver transplant patients has shown that no pharmacokinetic interaction occurs when adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg once daily is administered concomitantly with tacrolimus. A pharmacokinetic interaction between adefovir and ciclosporin is also considered unlikely as ciclosporin shares the same metabolic pathway as tacrolimus. Nevertheless, given that tacrolimus and ciclosporin can affect renal function, close monitoring is recommended when either of these agents is coadministered with adefovir dipivoxil.Hepsera Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, August 2009.
Adefovir	Cidofovir	Caution is advised as co-administration of adefovir may increase serum concentrations of either drug via competition for renal excretion pathways or affecting renal function. Close monitoring of renal function is required.	Caution is advised in patients receiving other medicinal products that may affect renal function or are excreted renally (e.g. cyclosporin and tacrolimus, intravenous aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, pentamidine, vancomycin, or medicinal products which are secreted by the same renal transporter, human Organic Anion Transporter 1 (hOAT1), such as cidofovir). Co-administration of 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil with medicinal products in these patients may lead to an increase in serum concentrations of either adefovir or a co-administered medicinal product.

Adefovir	Cobicistat (with ATV or DRV)	Coadministration has not been studied but based on the metabolism and clearance a clinically significant drug-drug interaction is unlikely. Adefovir is eliminated renally via glomerular filtration and active renal secretion by OAT1 and cobicistat is unlikely to inhibit OATs at clinically relevant concentrations. Note, cobicistat has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine and should not be initiated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 70 ml/min if adefovir requires dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance.

Adefovir	Delavirdine	In a pharmacokinetic substudy of a randomised clinical trial, delavirdine concentrations were reduced by approximately 50% in the delavirdine plus adefovir arms compared with the delavirdine arms. The AUC of adefovir was not significantly changed.	In a pharmacokinetic substudy of a randomized, partially double-blinded, multicenter study in a population of indinavir-experienced subjects with virologic failure (ACTG 884), 12-hour pharmacokinetics was conducted after 2 weeks administration of saquinavir/ritonavir with delavirdine (group A, n=6), adefovir dipivoxil (group B, n=7), or both (group C, n=5), and saquinavir plus nelfinavir with delavirdine (group D, n=7), adefovir dipivoxil (group E, n=6), or both (group F, n=6). Delavirdine concentrations were reduced by approximately 50%, in the delavirdine plus adefovir dipivoxil arms compared with the delavirdine arms. The AUC of adefovir dipivoxil were not significantly different among the different groups. This drug-drug interaction was not expected, the mechanism(s) is (are) not clear, and additional studies are warranted.Competing drug-drug interactions among multidrug antiretroviral regimens used in the treatment of HIV infected subjects: ACTG 884 Fletcher C, Acosta E, Cheng H et al.
